# COS2611 - Programming: Data Structures

Welcome to the COS2611 organization on GitHub! This organization is aimed at university students studying "COS2611: Programming: Data Structures" and is dedicated to helping students learn data structures using C++.

The purpose of this organization is to encourage student participation and facilitate learning by providing a platform where students can access various resources, including code examples, solutions to programming challenges, and discussion forums where they can seek and provide help.

Most of the code examples provided in this organization are taken from the book [Data Structures Using C++ - Second Edition](https://www.takealot.com/data-structures-using-c/PLID38560092) by DS Malik. We have adapted and modified these examples to better suit the needs of the students studying COS2611.

## First off

This organization is run by students and it is a work in progress (as of March 2023). The *study objectives* for this organization are listed below. Contributions to this organization will be made over time, so check back for updates.
If there is something in particular you would like help with, please see the *contact us* section below and get in touch.

## How to use these repositories

These repositories contain various resources to help students learn data structures using C++. Here's a quick overview of what you can find in this repository:

- Code examples: These repositories contain code examples that cover various topics related to data structures using C++. You can use these examples to practice coding and to get a better understanding of how data structures work.
- Programming challenges: We have included programming challenges in this repository to help you practice your programming skills. These challenges are designed to test your knowledge of data structures and to help you apply the concepts you have learned in class.
- Discussions: We encourage students to participate in discussions on the discussion forums to ask and answer questions, share tips and best practices, and help each other learn.
Contributing to this repository

We welcome contributions from students and anyone interested in data structures and C++.
